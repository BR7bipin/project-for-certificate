# project-for-certificate

This Python program is a simple command line based Task Manager application. It allows the user to add new tasks, display all saved tasks, search tasks using keywords, and remove tasks using task ID. The program stores all tasks in a JSON file so that the data is not lost after the program is closed. It uses a main() function as the entry point and a TaskManager class to handle all task operations such as saving, loading, adding, deleting, and searching tasks. The program is easy to use, user friendly, and suitable for basic task management through the command line.
